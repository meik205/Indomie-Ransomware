# Indomie Ransomware

**Indomie Ransomware** is a basic hybrid ransomware project written in **C#**, designed for educational and research purposes only.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- ‚úÖ Hybrid encryption using:
  - **AES-256**: For fast and secure file encryption.
  - **RSA-2048**: For encrypting the AES key.
- ‚úÖ Can **bypass Windows Defender** using simple evasion techniques.
- ‚úÖ Written entirely in **C#** ‚Äî easy to understand, modify, and extend.

## üîê Encryption Process

1. Generates a random **AES-256 key** for each victim.
2. Encrypts files in selected directories using AES.
3. Encrypts the AES key with an embedded **RSA-2048 public key**.
4. Optionally drops a ransom note with system info and encrypted key ID.

## üß™ Test Environment

- Recommended to test inside a **virtual machine** (VM).
- Works on **Windows 10/11**, x64 architecture.
